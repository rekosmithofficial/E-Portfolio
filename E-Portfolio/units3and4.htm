		<h2><b>Web Design and Development</b></h2>
		<p>This unit covers all about HTML, or Hyper-Text Markup Language, CSS, or Cascade Style Sheets, and later on, Javascript.
		We've particularly looked at why we use HTML and CSS, the different types of CSS (internal, inline and external), and the history
		behind HTML. We also have access to Lynda.com which helps in the coding of this website you're on.
		Learning about usability and accessibility is important too, particularly for those who have disabilities that affects
		the way they access webpages.
		</p>
		<b>What have I done currently?</b>
		<p>It's primarly been working on my assignment to create a website from scratch - incorporating what I've learned over
		the past 2 months. I hope I've done well in my assignment... I think if you've been able to reach this webpage then I've
		done something right (hopefully)! </p>
		</p>
		<b>How am I finding it?</b>
		<p> There's a lot to do when coding a website, though I won't be the only one saying that.
		It's interesting and good knowledge to know how to code in HTML and CSS - plus it allows me to 
		make creative choices, which is what I enjoy!

		<h2><b>Programming</b></h2>
		<p>This unit deals with coding in Processing/Java, understanding procedural and object-oriented programming in Processing.
This unit is a lot of typing and a lot of thinking, because there is always problems that require solutions with coding.		
		</p>
		<b>What have I done currently?</b>
		<p>
		It's similar to what I did at A-Level with Visual Basic - learning about procedures, functions, constructers, classes, elements, objects...
		there's also things that are new to me like the draw() function and the setup() function used in Java - but what I've found is because of
		someting called "standardisation" where high-level programming languages generally follow the same types of rules, procedures, etc.
		For example, to delcare a variable in Visual Basic is "dim{variablename}As{variabletype}", in Java it's simply "{variable type}_{variable name}.
		</p>
		<b>How am I finding it?</b>
		<p>It's going well, nothing too difficult. Might get stuck a few times but with any coding as I say it's about solving the problems it presents.
		The challenge will come when I have to code a program of some sorts.
