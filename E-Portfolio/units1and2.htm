		<h2><b>The Four Units in my Course</b></h2>

		<h2><b>Computer Games Fundamentals</b></h2>
		<p>This unit covers the practical side of video games, in terms of Programming, 
		and the theoretical side of video games, which is all about the ideas behind
		designing and developing a game.
		</p>
		<b>What have I done currently?</b>
		<p>In my first week, we were debating about gaming addictions, and how they
		compare to other addictions, and if they can be measured as something that is dangerous.<br><br>
		In my second week, we learned about game history. We learned that game history hasn't
		even been declared as a field of study, yet if we were to study it, they are broken down
        into six perspectives. Furthermore, we were introduced to Schell's four elements of a game:
		Aesthetics, Story, Technology and Mechanics. Schell also mentions different types of interest 
		that attracts people to play video games.
		<br><br>
		Third week, we questioned what a game actually was, with the help of Jesper Juul's interpretation,
		In the labs, we were introduced to the Unity game engine, and for the next 4 or so weeks, we
		work on building an environment and terrain.
		In lectures, we later on move onto PEGI ratings, and how different games are categorised, and how
		there's different rating systems across the world.
		</p>
		<b>How am I finding it?</b>
		<p>This is easily my favourite unit, and there is no guesses to why that is.
		I find it intriguing about why we even like to play games, and the different
		concepts and ideas about how to craft one, what I need to be thinking about when
		crafing one, and understanding the history behind video games. Also, there's making
		a video game environment with a game engine. I consider myself as a creative person, 
		so to expirement with Unity is in many ways a blessing to me!

		<h2><b>Computer Systems Fundamentals</b></h2>
		<p>This unit is comprised of stuying algebra and digital logic, as well as Mathematics - this includes things like:
		Logic gates, Logic Functions, Algebraic functions, Algebraic equations, Karnaugh maps, binary logic, etc.
		In Mathematics, we learn such things like: Vectors, Sets, Matrices, Number Systems, etc.
		</p>
		<b>What have I done currently?</b>
		<p>
		Quite a lot, especially learning about how logic gates work, the different symbols and how to use LogiSim, which calculates
		the result of whatever input I use and what type of logic gates I used.
		Additionally, understanding how we can use decoders, half-adders and full-adders to calculate the outputs of binary logic.
		We use boolean laws, a form of algebraic equations, to help assist with calculating outputs of binary logic.
		On the Mathematics side, that's understanding about how sets, matrices and vectors work etc, etc,.
		</p>
		<b>How am I finding it?</b>
		<p>Comfortable so far, but I'm not a stranger to some of the things I've been taught as I have done Computer Science at A-Level.
		However, I am no fan of Mathematics, despite it being important in my course. It's not my favourite unit, probably my least 
		favourable, but that's okay.
