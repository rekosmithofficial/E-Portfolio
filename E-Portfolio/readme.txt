Hello, here's a step-to-step guide and notes to my E-Portfolio Submission.
---
INDEX - Main Page
---
The Index is my main webpage, and features a Navigation bar, an 'About Me' section, 'Personal Details' 
section and 'Qualifications' section. I have also placed an image of me with a group of young people, 
as well as create my own header in Photoshop.

{Layout} I have chosen to place my tables of information (the Personal Details and Qualifications sections) 
to the right-hand side of the screen, because it makes sense to place things relevant near each other.
The 'About Me' section occupies the left-hand side. The image sits underneath it, as it doesn't hold
any specific importance compared to the 'About Me' section.

{Tables} I have chosen to use tables to record my personal details and qualifications. This will make it easy for the
reader to follow and understand. Additionally it is the easiest way to create rows and columns.

---
UNITS 1&2, 3&4
---
They both contain: Brief Overview of each of the 4 units, What I've Learned So Far, How I'm Feeling About the Unit,
and an accomanying image.
There is also a hyperlink to the Processing.org website under the Programming section.

{Layout} I opted for a symmetrical/split of information, since two units are on each page, it makes sense to put one unit
on one side, and the other unit on the other side. This is so it's easier to read and understand.
I also added images to get an idea of what equipment I'm using in each unit.

PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
---
This page contains a list of my skills set, things I could improve, and my experiences.
I was going to add pictures but I ran out of time. Under 'Experiences', there are hyperlinks to the relevant roles
that I occupy, and said section is in a table. The other two sections are in lists because I was listing skills.

PLEASE NOTE: The link to my personal website and to my organisation's websites: 
(www.rekosmith.weebly.com/www.youngcarersgroup.weebly.com)
do not work on the Eduroam wifi, but the links are not broken and they do work.

IN GENERAL
---
{Accessibility and Usability}
 When using images and sections, I tend to use percentages and pixels to size and scale.
Additionally, the colour scheme I chosen is simplistic and professional, and should be okay to read.
The navigation is embedded into the header aesthetically, this was a mere design choice.
There are no broken links, and everything should work as intended.
The Index, Unit Pages and Personal Development have different layouts, again this was a design choice
and I wanted to show my ability to be creative.
The coding has minimal comments, If I had longer I would have added more.
Additionally with those that use text-to-speech, the tab button does jump to links,
it doesn't however have "alt=" tags to help assist with recognising image captions.
There shouldn't be any syntax errors in the coding or on the website.
There is no footer, as I ran out of time to add one.

I hope this was some help to you.
